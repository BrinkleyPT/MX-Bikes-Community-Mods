**Author:** [YourName or Handle]  
**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

This document contains my personal recommended third-person camera settings for MX Bikes, tested across different bikes and tracks. These settings aim to improve rider visibility, immersion, and feedback (especially rumble).

## 🔧 Camera Settings

| Setting          | Value |
|------------------|-------|
| Camera Distance  | `80`  |
| Camera Height    | `75`  |
| View Type        | Third-Person (External) |

✅ **Why this setup?**  
- Balanced field of view  
- Strong visual-rumble feedback alignment  
- Lets you clearly see the rider sit/stand transitions  
- Stable across various terrain types

| JV MX Park       | KTM 450 SX-F 2023    | MX           | Holds up well through jumps and corners |
| SnowyTrails      | KTM 300 EXC 2021     | Enduro/Snow  | Great visual response even in slippery terrain |

### ⚠️ Experimental / Not Recommended

| Distance | Height | Verdict        | Reason |
|----------|--------|----------------|--------|
| `80`     | `70`   | Too Immersive  | Rumbling didn't match visual feedback, felt off |

## 📌 Final Recommendation

If you're seeking a **balanced third-person experience** that feels responsive, immersive, and consistent across bikes and tracks, start with:

**`Camera Distance: 80` — `Camera Height: 75`**
