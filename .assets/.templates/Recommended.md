**Author:** BrinkleyPT  
**Last Updated:** 23-07-2025

This document contains my personal recommended third-person camera settings for MX Bikes, tested across different bikes and tracks. These settings aim to improve rider visibility, immersion, and feedback (especially rumble).

## 🔧 Camera Settings

| Setting          | Value |
|------------------|-------|
| Camera Distance  | `80`  |
| Camera Height    | `75`  |
| View Type        | Third-Person (External) |

✅ **Why this setup?**  
- Balanced field of view  
- Strong visual-rumble feedback alignment  
- Lets you clearly see the rider sit/stand transitions  
- Stable across various terrain types

### ⚠️ Experimental / Not Recommended

| Distance | Height | Verdict        | Reason |
|----------|--------|----------------|--------|
| `80`     | `70`   | Too Immersive  | Rumbling didn't match visual feedback, felt off |

|----------|--------|-------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `50`     | `75`   | 0           | Closer look    | Nice if you want to have a closer look: more suitable for smaller screens/devices | ⭐⭐         |
