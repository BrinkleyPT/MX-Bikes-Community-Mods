# MX Bikes Community Mods Archive

A community-driven archive of **free mods** for *MX Bikes*, aimed at preserving access to content, crediting original creators, and making installation easier for everyone.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a **backup archive** for free mods such as:
- Bikes
- Tracks
- Rider gear
- Misc tools or plugins

If an original source (like MXB-Mods) ever goes offline or links break, this archive aims to preserve the content with proper credits.

## 🧭 What You'll Find

Each mod will include:
- Original creator's name (if available)
- Original posting link (MXB-Mods, forum post, etc.)
- Any readme or license files included by the author
- A clear folder structure to ease installation

I strongly support and respect the work of the original modders.

## 📩 DMCA / Takedown Requests

To speed up the process, please include:
