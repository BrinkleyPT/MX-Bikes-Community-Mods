**MAKE SURE TO BACKUP YOUR DATA BEFORE STARTING**

1) Clear cache folder contents

2) Clear/delete the specific problematic track folder (PiBoSo/MX Bikes/profiles/your-profile-name/tracks/specific_track_folder)

3) Optional: delete the track's specific folder (PiBoSo/MX Bikes/profiles/your-profile-name/setups/specific_track_folder)

_(this will rebuild whatever is wrong with your track)_
